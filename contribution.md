## Adding Resources

### Step 1
Create new branch name `resource-<name of your topic>`

### Step 2
If you want to create new topic

Create new folder named `<name_of_your_topic>` <br/>
Note: __Before creating a new folder, it's important to take a moment to consider whether the content you are adding already fits within an existing folder or topic. This can help avoid unnecessary clutter and confusion in your filing system. Therefore, it's essential to be mindful and intentional when creating new folders.__

Create file name `<name of your topic>.md` or modify the existing file (only if your topic is the subtopic of that file.)

If you create new file:
Use this format

`topic.md`
```md
- [Subtopic1](/resources/field/topic/subtopic1)
- [Subtopic2](/resources/field/topic/subtopic2)

## Subtopic1
Lorem [tag or short description] (★☆☆☆☆): www.youtube.com
<hr/>

## Subtopic2
Lorem (★★☆☆☆): www.youtube.com

### Documents
Lorem Remlo [tag or short description]: www.somearticle.or.paper.com
<hr/>
```

If you want to modify the existing file:

> Please add your topic in the end of the file.

`existing.md`
```md
... existing subtopic ...
- [your subtopic](/resources/field/topic/subtopic1)


... subtopic ...
## your subtopic
Lorem (★★☆☆☆): www.youtube.com

### Documents
Lorem Remlo [tag or short description]: www.somearticle.or.paper.com
<hr/>
```

If you want to add new resources on existing subtopic just add it like this
```md
## Existing subtopic
Lorem (★★☆☆☆): www.youtube.com
Your reources title (★★☆☆☆): link

### Documents
Lorem Remlo [tag or short description]: www.somearticle.or.paper.com
Your resource title [tag or short description]: link

## Adding Work to Archive

We always appreciate contributions to our project's documentation! To get started, follow these steps:

### Step 1
Choose the appropriate category (folder) for your project. This will help keep our documentation organized and make it easier for others to find what they need. For example, if you are contributing to a project related to machine learning, you would want to add your documentation to the "machine-learning" folder.

```
|- work_archive/
|   |- work1/
|   |   |- title1.md
|   |- <your work dir>/
|       |- <your work name>.md
```
### Step 2
Copy the README file from your project and add it to the folder. This will ensure that your documentation is consistent with the rest of the project and provides a clear overview of your work.

### Step 3
Add a GitHub icon and link to your repository. This will allow others to easily access your code and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement. For example, you could add an icon like this: <img src="https://github.com/favicon.ico" width="16"> and link it to your GitHub repository like this: [:icon-mark-github: Github]().
```[:icon-mark-github: Github](link)```

### Step 4
Open a pull request and request one of our admins to review it. This step is important because it allows us to ensure that all contributions are high quality and consistent with our guidelines. Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, your contribution will be merged into the main documentation for the project!
